# Introduction to Data Science

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract insights from data.

## What is Data Science?

Data science encompasses various methodologies and techniques for analyzing structured and unstructured data. It involves the application of statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and computational tools to discover patterns and generate actionable insights.

Data science processes are well documented in academic literature [@van2016data; @cao2017data].

### Key Components of Data Science

- **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data from various sources
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing and preparing data for analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding data patterns and relationships
- **Machine Learning**: Building predictive and descriptive models
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful visual representations
- **Communication**: Presenting findings to stakeholders

## Statistics Foundations

The normal distribution is a fundamental probability distribution used to model

$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$.
